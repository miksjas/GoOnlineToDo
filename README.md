# GoOnlineToDo

GoOnlineToDo is a simple **.NET 8 Minimal API** project built with **Clean Architecture**.  
It provides a REST API for managing ToDo tasks and uses **PostgreSQL** with **Entity Framework Core** for persistence.  
The solution also uses **Aspire** for orchestration, includes a migration service and test project, and exposes an interactive **Scalar UI** for exploring the API.
